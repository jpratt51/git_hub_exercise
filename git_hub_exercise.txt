GitHub Exercise
Part I
Letâ€™s start by taking a bit of time to practice the git workflow below. It is so valuable to just practice this workflow a couple times, since you will most likely doing it professionally as well as in your individual projects and open source contributions. Here are some things to do.

1. Create a local repository and add and commit some files
	mkdir git_hub_exercise
	touch git_hub_exercise.txt
	git init
	git add .
	git commit . -m"first commit"

2. Create a remote repository and push your code from the local repo to the remote
	git remote add origin https://github.com/jpratt51/git_hub_exercise.git
	git branch -M main
	git push -u origin main

3. Create a local branch and add and commit some files
	git checkout -b newbranch
	touch file_2 file_3
	git add file_2 file_3
	git commit . m-"add files file_2, file_3"

4. Push that local branch to GitHub to create a remote branch
	git push origin newbranch


Part II - Put your memory game on GitHub pages
Using GitHub pages, deploy your memory game from the previous unit so that you can share them with anyone!
